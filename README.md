# Machine Translation System
Built Machine Translation System using different approaches

# Goal
- [x] [RNN based model with Luong Attention](rnn_attention.py)
- [x] [Fully Attention based Transformer model](transformers.py)

# Model Architectures
## 1) Neural Machine Translation System using RNN with Attention
Implemented the seq2seq model with Luong attention for building NMTS <br>

## 2) Neural Machine Translation System using Transformer
Implemented the Transformer for building NMTS <br>

# Some cool stuff
- [x] Mixed precision (float16-float32) based training
- [ ] Distributed training support
- [ ] Initial embedding from pretrained models (taking eng and ger embedding from gpt2 trained on eng and ger respectively)
- [ ] Final layer embedding same as initial embedding
