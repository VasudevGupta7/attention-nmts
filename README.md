# Seq2Seq- TensorFlow2
Implementing the seq2seq model with different approaches. I am using spacy for nlp tasks and tensorflow2 for this model implementation

## Goal
- [x] [Building NMTS using seq2seq architecture with Luong Attention](/nmts_attention)
- [ ] Fully Attention based MT model

## Getting Started
Install tensorflow2 using following command:<br>
`pip install tensorflow`<br>

To get started with nlp tasks, install spacy along with models for english and german by running the following commands:<br>
`pip install spacy`<br>
`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`<br>
`python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm`<br>

For more details, refer this:
- [TensorFlow docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
- [spaCy docs](https://spacy.io/usage)
